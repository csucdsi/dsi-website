## Making Your Blogpost Work

Our website has some constraints regarding inline code execution and interactive dashboards. To ensure your blogpost displays correctly:

- **Code Formatting:**  
  Use markdown code fences to format any code snippets. This helps maintain readability and prevents execution issues.

- **Interactive Content:**  
  Interactive elements (such as dashboards or widgets) may not render as expected. Consider:

  - Converting interactive content into static images.
  - Hosting interactive elements externally and linking to them.

- **Dependencies:**  
  Minimize external dependencies that could affect load times or display issues on our site.

- **Local Testing:**  
  Preview your post locally using Quarto to confirm that everything renders as expected. Check for any discrepancies in formatting or functionality.

- **Assistance:**  
  If you run into issues with code or interactive elements, reach out to your assigned WDH team member for troubleshooting and support.
