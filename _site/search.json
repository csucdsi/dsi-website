    "text": "This document explains how to install R and RStudio with Homebrew on Mac OS.\n\nMain Instructions\nThe steps below will install Homebrew, R, and RStudio. Open a terminal and run the following commands.\n\nInstall Homebrew.\n\nusr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\nThis command will download, install, and set up Homebrew. The first time a brew command runs it will ask for a password.\n\nInstall R with the following commands:\n\nbrew tap homebrew/science # adds another source for applications.\nbrew install r            # runs installer of r\nThe first command is necessary if you want to add science/math type applications. The second command handles all the installation of R itself. As of 3.25.2017 this installs version . This can take a while because Homebrew downloads then builds the tools though it tends to be faster an easier than manual installation.\n\nInstall RStudio with the following command:\n\nbrew cask install rstudio\nTry navigating to RStudio to verify installation.\n\nOptional Set up RStudio to work from the command line.\n\necho \"alias rstudio='open -a RStudio'\" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile\nsource ~/.bash_profile\nThis sets up your bash profile to run RStudio when rstudio is entered into the command line (i.e. rstudio example.rmd). It adds and alias to your ~/.bash_profile so you can remove it if you want.\nThis concludes the installation of RStudio. The rest of this documentation is more on Homebrew.\n\n\nBackground and Info on Homebrew.\n\nWhat is Homebrew.\nHomebrew is a package manager for macOS (MacOS X) that claims to be The missing package manager to macOS. You can use this to find open source and UNIX tools that most Linux distros have but don’t natively show up on Mac (i.e. wget and imagemagick). It works from the command line and it makes installing, updating, and removing packages easier.\n\n\nSome useful commands:\nBe careful with these because they do alter/remove applications.\n\nUpdate and Upgrade your packages.\n$ brew update   # update the formula\n$ brew upgrade  # Upgrade outdated, unpinned brews.\nList your installed packages.\n$ brew list     # lists all installed brews\nRemove an Application bash     $ brew uninstall &lt;formula&gt;\n\nFor more information on Homebrew navigate to brew.sh."

Data sets from metropolitan police departments in Baltimore, Cincinnati, and Seattle are available for participants to peruse in formulating analyses and recommending innovative solutions to enhance public safety. Teams of 2 to 5 high school or college undergraduate students in the U.S. and Canada can submit an entry. Submissions are comprised of a short essay describing the team’s process and a presentation of the team’s analysis and recommendations via PowerPoint. Awards will be given in the categories of Best Overall Analysis, Best Visualization, and Best Use of External Data. Students need to register by October 20. Their submissions are due by November 3. Here is a link to more information about how your students can participate in this contest: http://thisisstatistics.org/policedatachallenge/ And here is a link to the This Is Statistics webpage that you can share with your students: http://thisisstatistics.org/students/\nTeam Chico! Contact Robin Donatello if you want to participate. You do not have to be a Statistics major to participate!\n\n\n“Data to Insight” MOOC\n“Data to Insight: An Introduction to Data Analysis” is a free online course by leading statistics educator Chris Wild. It provides a hands-on introduction to modern statistical data analysis, visualization and inference emphasizing key ideas and practical empowerment. It starts from the statistical basics and steps just enough beyond them for you to provide your students with glimpses of exciting potentials that lie almost within their grasp. The course started October 2, 2017, though people can join up to 10 weeks late. Here is a link to more information about it: https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/data-to-insight\n\n\n“What’s Going on in this Graph?” (WGOITG)\nThe American Statistical Association (ASA) has partnered with the New York Times Learning Network to help students better understand and think more critically about graphs. A variation of their popular “What’s Going on in this Picture?”, WGOITG will be a monthly feature starting September 19 and continuing the second Tuesday of the following months (October 10, November 14, etc.) through the end of the school year in May. Led by Sharon Hessney, the ASA team includes Corey Andreasen, Anna Bargagliotti, Chris Franklin, Stephen Miller, and Roxy Peck. A graph from a NYT news article will be presented on those dates with live moderation from 9 am - 2 pm around the following questions: (1) What do you notice?, (2) What do you wonder?, and (3) What’s going on in this graph?. On the Friday following the activity, the NYT LN will publish a follow up with details about the graph and statistical observations/lessons from Sharon and the team. Here is a link to more information: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/learning/announcing-a-new-monthly-feature-whats-going-on-in-this-graph.html\n\n\nUSPROC\nThe Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE) and the American Statistical Association (ASA) are sponsoring the Undergraduate Statistics Project Competition (USPROC). The purpose of USPROC is to encourage the development of data analysis skills, to enhance presentation skills, and to recognize outstanding work by undergraduate statistics students. Competition tracks are available for projects at different levels (including the introductory/intermediate statistics levels). Here is a link to more information about how your students can submit their projects: https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/home\n\n\neUSR\nThe 2017 Electronic Undergraduate Statistics Research Conference (eUSR) will take place on Friday, November 3, 2017. This free e-conference includes a keynote address from a Data Scientist at Stack Overflow, a career panel including the Head of Data Science at Lyft, other panels on graduate school and diversity in Statistics and Data Science, and presentations by USPROC student award winners. I’m attaching to this e-mail a flyer that you can give your students.

Teams of students get a dataset on Friday afternoon and work on the problem until Sunday afternoon where they present their findings. After two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, and presentation design, each team is allowed a few minutes and no more than two slides to impress a panel of judges. Prizes are given for Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Use of External Data.\nUndergraduates from all majors are welcome. Some of the most diverse teams have been the most successful.\nA key feature of ASA DataFest is that it brings together the data science community. Undergraduate students do the work, but they are assisted by roving consultants who are graduate students, faculty, and industry professionals.\nLearn more about this national event at the event website\n\n\nRegister Here Now!\n\n\n\n\nlogo"

[RSVP here]\n\nAbstract:\n\nMuch of the statistics taught today is more accurately known as frequentist statistics – a distinction that gets little attention. However, an alternative exists and the alternative bridges what some see as a gap between statisticians and computer scientists who apply mathematical models to data. Bayesian statistics is the alternative. This talk will motivate Bayesian statistics in multiple ways. First, we’ll introduce Bayesian statistics with some old baseball data. Then we’ll dissect the baseball example, describing just how random variables play a role. The entire discussion will be high level, with little to no statistical background required. Pretty plots will complement all mathematical details._\n\nSee the rest of the DSI Spring 18 [Seminar and Workshop schedule] here."

The internal scan will review internal data (President’s Listening Tour, Campus Climate Survey, Alumni Attitude Survey, Spring Graduate Survey, etc.) to identify institutional strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The external (environmental) scan will examine patterns of change in the surrounding environment that will impact Chico State as an institution in the future. This includes a wide range of metrics at the global, national, state, and regional level, including economic factors, demographic factors, higher education trends, etc. This is not a super hardcore data science position but will require a lot sifting through and visualizing data. In addition to helping with the scans, the student (if they chose to remain with the project) would assist with the planning and execution of strategic planning campus engagement events, analysis of campus engagement data, and other tasks associated with the strategic planning process.\nTime commitment: This is a paid position open until filled. Summer hours up to 40hr/wk, and up to 20 hours (at least 15) during the semester if interested.\nRequirements: Applicants should have a basic grasp of statistical methods, a solid grasp of MS Excel and functions, data cleansing and formatting, graphing, etc. Experience with tools like Tableau or PowerBI would be a bonus.

You don’t need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.\nThe Carpentries are a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using lessons and datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what they’ve learned to their own work. We’re really excited about using the Software Carpentry curriculum here to help our researchers become more efficient in their research.\nThis workshop is focused on Reproducible Scientific research using R. The curriculum will include:\n\nDay 1: Monday August 13, 9am - 4:30 pm\n\nOrganizing data in spreadsheets\nGetting started with R and Markdown\n\nDay 2: Tuesday August 14, 9am - 4:30 pm\n\nCommand line power: using the shell\nData visualization and manipulation\n\nDay 3: (optional) Wednesday August 13, 9am - 12 noon\n\nVersion control in R Studio using Projects\nBuilding websites in R with Markdown\n\n\nThe target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience, and the instructors put a priority on creating a friendly environment to empower researchers and enable data-driven discovery. Even those with some experience will benefit, as the goal is to teach not only how to do analyses, but how to manage the process to make it as automated and reproducible as possible. For instance, after attending this workshop you will be able to:\n\nUse the unix shell to manage files without a graphical user interface.\nImport, process and visualize data sets in R Studio\nCreate reproducible scientific documents that are human readable.\n(Optional) Build a website where you can share research, post course materials, or start an e-portfolio to demonstrate your work.\n\nSpace is limited and it will likely fill quickly. There is a small fee for this event to provide refreshments for participants throughout the two days. If you cannot afford this fee contact us to disucss options.\nSee the workshop website for specific details on the topics, schedule and RSVP instructions.\nQuestions?

    "title": "Measuring Variation in the Empirical Storm Season Over Time",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This blog post attempts an analysis of the annual variability of dates on which storms formed during the years 1950 to 2016. Throughout, the word storm will refer to named tropical or subtropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean. The inspiration of this analysis came from a CSU, Chico campus seminar.\nDuring the Fall semester of 2017, CSU, Chico’s Dr. Ann Bykerk-Kauffman gave one of three talks at the Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences seminar titled 2017 Hurricane Talk. Part of Dr. Bykerk-Kauffman’s presentation included data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Hurricane Center’s (NHC) Data Archive: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat [Landsea:2013]. After her talk, Dr. David M. Hassenzahl, Dean of the College of Natural Sciences, asked a great question, which I’ll try to paraphrase: Is the variation of the empirical storm season changing over time?\nOne possible way to interpret the phrase variation of the empirical storm season goes like this. The official storm season is June 01 to November 30. The official storms season proves useful as a contrast to an empirical storm season. The word empirical refers to the actual dates for which the named storms in any given year form. Just because we define a storm season, does not mean all the storms form within the official storm season. Some years contain some storms outside the official storm season, and some years contain all storms within the official storm season – as we’ll see later, no year in our data set has all storms outside of the official storm season. Since there is not a direct correspondence between the official storm season and the empirical storm season, it’s useful to separate these two phrases. Last, the word variation describes the average distance (measured in days) from the middle of the empirical storm season.\nThere are of course other ways to measure the variation of the empirical storm season. This blog post attempts to quantify the annual variation of the empirical storm season in three different ways. The first attempt follows the logic in the last paragraph. The second attempt defines a percentage of storms that form outside of the official storm season, relative to the total number of storms in each year. The last attempt hypothesizes a probability distribution that produces storms throughout the year, and then asks if this distribution of storms changes over time.\nThe rest of this post proceeds as follows. Section 3 discusses some related research and briefly compares this analysis to previous efforts. Section 4 walks through the data preparation necessary for our analyses. Section 5 contains the bulk of the analysis, for which multiple measurements of variation of the storm season are considered as a time series. Here, we focus on Atlantic storms from the years 1950 to 2016. However, no qualitative, and only minor quantitative, differences are found by analyzing Pacific Ocean storms simiarly. The post is concluded in Section 6, and Sections 7 and 8 offer my appreciation to those who directly and indirectly made this analysis possible."

    "section": "Has the variation in the empirical storm season changed over time?",
    "text": "Has the variation in the empirical storm season changed over time?\nIn an effort to answer Dean Hassenzahl’s question, we attempt to measure the variation of the empirical storm season year over year. To measure such variation, we will use the median absolute deviation (MAD) statistic. The MAD statistic is an estimator of the population standard deviation σ, which is based on the median instead of the mean making it more robust to potential outliers.\nTo measure the variation of the emprical storm season over time, first consider a year \\(Y\\). In year \\(Y\\), there will be a handful of storms that occur at different times. Recall, we converted dates to numbers as per the discussion above in Section Data Preparation. Define the median storm date as the date corresponding to the median of the numbers that represent the storms’ dates.\ndf['median'] = df.groupby('year')['num_dates'].transform(lambda x: x.median())\ndf['median_date'] = mdates.num2date(df['median'])\nThe plot below depicts this visually for the year 2005. The histogram of storms in 2005 appears in blue, as do the vertical ticks representing each storm. The median storm date appears as the taller, red tick. \nidx_2005 = df['year'] == 2005\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8, 5))\nax.cla()\nbp.histogram(df['num_dates'].loc[idx_2005], bins=365//30)\nbp.rug(df['num_dates'].loc[idx_2005].values, markersize=20)\nbp.rug(df['median'].loc[idx_2005].values[:1], markersize=50, color='tab:red')\nplt.xlabel('Month', fontsize=20)\nplt.ylabel('Density', fontsize=20)      \nplt.title('Density of Storms in 2005', fontsize=20)\nax.set_xlim([datetime.datetime(2005, 1, 1), \n             datetime.datetime(2005, 12, 1)])  \nax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.AutoDateLocator())                                 \nax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mdates.DateFormatter('%m')) \nplt.tight_layout()\n\nBy this definition, across all the years, the median storm dates generaly fall in August or September. The following table depicts the counts of the median storm date within each numbered month, over all the years for which we have data.\ndf.drop_duplicates('year', inplace=False)['median_date'].dt.month.value_counts().sort_index()\n7      1\n8     23\n9     42\n10     1\nName: median_date, dtype: int64\nThe median storm date strictly measures an average storm date within year \\(Y\\). Variation on the other hand measures average distance from the median storm date. We measure distance from the median storm date in days. Since some storms form before the median storm date and some storms after, we take the absolute value of the distance of each storm from the median storm date. Our MAD estimator is the median of the absolute values of these distances. The last step scales our MAD estimator by \\(\\frac{1}{\\Phi^{-1}(0.75)} \\approx 1.4826\\), in a fairly standard assumption of normal data. In the end, we have MAD estimates of the variation of the empirical storm season for each year in our data set.\nTo help visualize this calculation, consider the plot above. For each storm (blue ticks), count the days between each storm and the median storm date (red tick), disregarding any potential negative signs. From these counts, calculate the median and then scale it by \\(1.4826\\). This calcuation is done for each year, and we refer to the collection of yearly statistics as the MAD estimates.\ndf['mad'] = df.apply(lambda x: np.abs((x['num_dates'] - x['median'])), axis=1)\nsdf = (df[['year', 'mad']].groupby('year', as_index=False)\n            .aggregate(lambda x: 1.4826*np.median(x)))\nA plot of the MAD estimates across time appears below. A non-zero slope would indicate a change in the variation of the empirical storm season across time. Hence, to answer Dean Hassenzahl’s question, we seek to quantify statistically the slope of these data.\nA standard first attempt would fit simple linear regression to these data. However, fitting linear regression to these data strictly ignores any possible correlation in storm seasons across time. In this scenario, each year is treated as independent. Recall, both Kossin and Kim treated their data as independent across time.\nTreating each year as independent can be suspicious and can lead to over confident conclusions. We are more interested in the semilocal linear trend model mentioned previously. As a comparison, we fit linear regression and the semilocal linear trend model.\nThe plot below depicts the MAD estimates of the storm season by year in blue, with the estimate from linear regression overlayed in red. The subtle negative slope indicates that, if anything, the variation of the emprical storm season is decreasing in time. The negative sign of this slope agrees qualitatively with Kim, but disagrees with Kossin and Karloski. Though we remind the reader that we are measureing the variation of the empirical storm season differently than Kossin and Karloski.

The slope is estimated to be \\(-0.007\\) with a standard error one order of magnitude larger. This indicates low confidence in the slope estimate.\nThe Durbin-Watson statistic is greater than 2, possibly indicating negative autocorrelation in these data, but there’s likely to be high uncertainty in this statistic as well.\nTo build upon this simple regression model, we will allow possible autocorrelation in the data. We next introduce the semilocal linear trend model.\n\nState Space Model\nA more sophisticated model for these data, such that we do not strictly rule out a correlation of the storm seasons across time, is the following Bayesian structural time series model. The semilocal linear trend model describes the time series of interest \\(y_{t}\\) as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny\\_t & = \\mu\\_t + \\epsilon\\_t \\newline\n\\mu\\_{t+1} & = \\mu\\_t + \\nu\\_t + \\gamma\\_t \\newline\n\\nu\\_{t+1} & = \\eta + \\phi(\\nu\\_t - \\eta) + \\zeta\\_t \\newline\n\\epsilon\\_t & \\sim \\mathbb{N}(0, \\sigma\\_y^2) \\newline\n\\gamma\\_t & \\sim \\mathbb{N}(0, \\sigma\\_{\\mu}^2) \\newline\n\\zeta\\_t & \\sim \\mathbb{N}(0, \\sigma\\_{\\nu}^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_t, \\gamma_t\\), and \\(\\zeta_t\\) are independent. The notation \\(\\mathbb{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\\) stands for a normal random variable with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nThe variable \\(\\eta\\), the long run slope in the time series, is of most interest. Specifically, we allow deviations from the slope, \\(\\nu\\_{t}\\), so long as the deviations \\(\\nu_{t}\\) tend to revert back to the long run slope. For more details on this model, consult Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods and the R package bsts’s help page on their semilocal linear trend model or their blog post about the semilocal linear trend model.\nHere, the time series of interest \\(y_t\\) is the yearly MAD estimates of variation of the empirical storm season. Since this model will better handle possible correlations across time in the MAD estimates of variation, we will have an appropriate estimate of the variation in the long run slope.\nIn Stan, we write this model as follows. The priors are discussed in the next subsection.\nlocal_linear = requests.get('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roualdes/stormevents/master/semilocal_linear.stan').text\nprint(local_linear)\ndata {\n  int &lt;lower=1&gt; T;\n  vector[T] x;\n  vector[T] y;\n}\ntransformed data {\n  real sd_y = sd(y);\n  real sd_x = sd(x);\n}\nparameters {\n  real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma_y;\n  vector[T] gamma;\n  real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma_gamma;\n  vector[T] zeta;\n  real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma_zeta;\n  real eta;\n  real&lt;lower=-1, upper=1&gt; phi;\n}\ntransformed parameters {\n  vector[T] mu;\n  vector[T] nu;\n\n  mu[1] = y[1] + sigma_gamma * gamma[1];\n  nu[1] = zeta[1];\n  for (t in 2:T) {\n    mu[t] = mu[t-1] + nu[t-1] + sigma_gamma * gamma[t];\n    nu[t] = eta + phi * (nu[t-1] - eta) + sigma_zeta * zeta[t];\n  }\n}\nmodel {\n  // likelihood\n  y ~ normal(mu, sigma_y);\n\n  // priors\n  sigma_y ~ exponential(1 / sd_y);\n  gamma ~ normal(0, 1);\n  sigma_gamma ~ gamma(2, 1 / sd_y);\n  zeta ~ normal(0, 1);\n  sigma_zeta ~ gamma(2, 1 / sd_y);\n  eta ~ student_t(3, 0, sd_y / sd_x);\n  phi ~ normal(0, 0.5);\n}\ngenerated quantities {\n  vector[T] y_pred;\n  for (t in 1:T)\n    y_pred[t] = normal_rng(mu[t], sigma_y);\n}\nIn order to fit this model to the yearly variation in the storm season, we need to compile the above Stan program.\nstmod = pystan.StanModel(model_code=local_linear)\nINFO:pystan:COMPILING THE C++ CODE FOR MODEL anon_model_c5a67a1a28bbc98cedc1cecc2429214e NOW.\n\nModel Priors\nThe semilocal linear trend model above is fit as a Bayesian model, hence there are priors are on all parameters. An effort has been made such that all priors are weakly informative. We tried to follow a combination of the guidelines established by the Stan community and the default priors for rstanarm [Stan-Development-Team:2016].\nSpecifically, the parameters \\(\\sigma\\_y, \\sigma\\_{\\gamma}, \\sigma\\_{\\zeta}, \\eta\\), and \\(\\phi\\) have priors. Let \\(y = (y_1, \\ldots, y_T)'\\) denote the observations of interest and \\(x\\) be the x-axis values along which the observations \\(y\\) are observed.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma\\_y & \\sim \\text{Exponential}(1 / \\text{sd}(y) ) \\newline\n\\sigma\\_{\\gamma} & \\sim \\Gamma(2, 1 / \\text{sd}(y) ) \\newline\n\\sigma\\_{\\zeta} & \\sim \\Gamma(2, 1 / \\text{sd}(y) ) \\newline\n\\eta & \\sim \\mathbb{t}\\_3(0, \\text{sd}(y) / \\text{sd}(x) ) \\newline\n\\phi & \\sim \\mathbb{N}(0, 0.5)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe prior on \\(\\sigma_y\\) attempts to match the scale of the standard deviation of the observations \\(y\\) by scaling an \\(\\text{Exponential(1)}\\) distribution appropriately. The scale parameters of \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\zeta\\) are given boundary avoiding priors and are scaled the same as \\(\\sigma_y\\). The prior on \\(\\eta\\) is treated as a regression coefficient in a multiple regression model and thus has a t-distribution on it with degrees of freedom that allow for as wide a distribution as possible with a finite variance. Since \\(\\eta\\) is a slope parameter it is given the ratio of standard deviations of \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) to match the scale of a simple linear regression slope of \\(y\\) on \\(x\\). The prior on \\(\\phi\\) attempts to weakly inform \\(\\phi\\) towards 0 with a standard deviation of 0.5. This leaves room for the data to insist upon a posterior distribution on \\(\\phi\\) to be near the extremes \\(-1\\) or \\(1\\).\nThe above model is fit with Stan, and random samples from the joint posterior distribution over the model parameters are extracted. We next evaluate the fit of the model and discuss the interpretation of the model in the context of the data.\nsdata = {                                                                            \n    'T': sdf.shape[0], \n    'x': np.arange(sdf.shape[0]),\n    'y': sdf['mad'].values.ravel()\n}\nstfit = stmod.sampling(data=sdata,\n                      control={'adapt_delta': .99})                                                                                                                                    \nposterior = stfit.extract()  \n/Users/ez/py3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pystan/misc.py:399: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated.

In some years, all the storms form within the official storm season. In other years, there are a few storms that form outside the official storm season.

Divide the number of storms that form outside the official storm season in a given year by the number of named storms that formed in that year and then multiply by 100.

    "text": "Is the Distribution of the Empirical Storm Season Stationary?\nConsider the average density histogram above, where the empirical storm season was averaged over all the years for which we have data. Let’s refer to this histogram as the average storm season. If the empirical storm season was not changing over time, then this average storm season would represent the stationary distribution from which each year’s storm season was randomly drawn. If such a stationary storm season producing distribution exists, then no year’s storm season in our data set should be too different from the average storm season.\nTo evaluate the stationarity of the storm season, we compute such a histogram for each year’s empirical storm season separately. For instance, consider the histogram of the storms from 2005. Now imagine we overlayed the average storm season histogram with the histogram from the 2005 storm season. We calculate the maximal, absolute difference between these two histograms. This idea is most easily visualized with histograms, but in fact we do all the calculations with the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the empirical storm seasons. Intuitively, these ideas are similar. In fact, this is just the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic, for each year’s storm season relative to the average storm season.\nWe walk through each step of the calculations involved. First, we calculate the average storm season.\nhist, bins = np.histogram(df['cnum_dates'], \n                          bins=df['cnum_dates'].nunique(), density=True)\ncdf = np.cumsum(hist)\necdf = cdf/cdf[-1]\nNext, we’ll replicate this calculation for each year in our data set.\nks = []\nfor year in np.nditer(df['date'].dt.year.unique()):\n    h, _ = np.histogram(df['cnum_dates'][df['date'].dt.year == year], \n                        bins=df['cnum_dates'].nunique(), density=True)\n    bcdf = np.cumsum(h)\n    ks.append(np.max(np.abs(ecdf - bcdf/bcdf[-1])))\nsdf['KS'] = np.array(ks)*100\nThe plot below displays the year over year KS statistics. There appears to be a negative slope over time. We remind the reader that the yearly KS statistics appear in absolute value.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last week Chico State hosted it’s first Software Carpentry workshop and it was a great success. We were thrilled to have Reid Otsuji from UC San Diego and a Library Carpentry instructor come up to help teach the material.\nWe had three undergraduate students help out as technical assistant roaming helpers throughout the workshop: Grant Esparza (Computer Science), Jerry Tucay (Applied Mathematics & Statistics), and Eisley Adoremos (Statistics). Their assistance with answer questions and helping add to the collaborate class notes was invaluable! We couldn’t have done it without them.\n\nLearners\nOur learners were a mixture of undergraduate and graduate students from non technical majors, many faculty and staff from Chico State, external faculty from Sacramento State and researchers from UC Davis, and community business members. Such a blending of backgrounds and experiences was fantastic.\nWhat was most impressive was the turnout from the Center for Healthy Communities. I will be working with this Center on a new CalFresh outreach grant and am looking forward to helping to streamline and automate many of their reporting processes.\n\n\nLesson Details\nThe details of the workshop can be seen on the workshop webpage, which also includes links to the lesson materials. I will still summarize it here.\nDay 1 we started off with Reid discussing best practices on organizing and recording data in spreadsheets. He covered common pitfalls, problems with dates, data entry and the like. Learners got a chance to take a “messy” spreadsheet and try to reformat into something that is readable by a computer program. After a gentle introduction to the R language and the R studio interface, it was time for a well deserved lunch.\nThen in the afternoon I got to demonstrate how awesome markdown is, and how combined with the powers of R they too could make awesome websites (such as this one and my personal website), as well as other HTML pages and PDF reports. We dug more into the guts of the R programming language in how R handles data sets (using data frames), how to explore these data frames, how to make new variables, logical statements and such.\nDay 2 Reid introduced the learners to the Bash Shell. We discussed file hierarchy, benefits to using a command line interface as opposed to a GUI, how to navigate your file system (great setup for learning relative vs. absolute paths), and how to edit files in Nano.\n\nThe second afternoon returned us to R, this time specifically I gave a very short introduction to Data visualization using ggplot. Only having an hour I really didn’t have time to get into many of the statistical graphic examples I would have liked to. The other main topic that afternoon was using dplyr for data manipulation and aggregation.\n\nDay 3 I have been toying around with writing a lesson for contribution to the Carpentries on how to build a website using RMarkdown. I wrote it originally to test out at a Carpentry workshop at UC Davis in January 17, but got food poisoning the night before so I didn’t get to test it out. Reid was interested so we invited everyone to attend an optional 3rd morning on using git and GitHub for version control, and building simple websites.\nI was thrilled when 6 participants (most from CHC) along with the 3 student helpers showed up to have fun with git. I really wish we had a full day to devote to this. We only had time to teach the bare minimum git (what it does,add, commit, push and pull) enough to use git along with R projects to make the website. Everyone walked out of that half day with a functioning webpage, and we had a great discussion about what it could be used for (class notes, project website, informational dashboard, file submission etc)\n\n\nCollaboration\nThroughout the workshop, participants took notes using the online markdown document sharing platform called HackMD. HackMD is like Google docs but written in Markdown. It was a great hands on way for learners to see how to write Markdown code without “formal” instruction. The notes have been locked at this point and are available for view and downloading without any login necessary.\n\n\nFeedback\nWhile I know Reid and I had fun, what was more important is that the learners had fun and felt their time was worthwhile. As part of being an officially recognized Carpentry workshop, The Carpentries hosted a pre and post survey. This is critical for the instructors to have to help assess if we were successful in our attempts to share these skills and tools. I want to share some kind words we received via email,\n\nThe workshop was a real help in getting started with R. I’m really glad that I attended.\n\nand survey responses about things that were considered major strengths of the workshop\n\npurposefully having us make mistakes and learning how to correct them -strategies for trouble shooting\n\n\nHackMD was critical to staying on track Very open to on-going questions and discusssions on how applied to different disciplines\n\n\nShowed us ways to apply these techniques to our own research.\n\n\nI got exposure to coding and it was amazing how relevant it was to the type of work I’ve done before in excel and how easier it is to work on in R vs. excel.\n\nI look forward to reviewing the rest of the survey information, especially the section on what we can do to improve. It’s important for all instructors to understand we can always get better, and we are very thankful for the information that the learners provided.\n\n\nFuture learning\nThe DSI will continue hosting weekly community coding sessions, short workshops and seminars throughout the Fall 2018 semester. We are always looking for people interested in speaking and sharing their knowledge. If your group would like to do a personalized set of trainings please contact us for details.\n\n\n\nLinks\n\nhttps://software-carpentry.org/\nhttps://www2.archivists.org/prof-education/faculty/reid-otsuji\nhttps://librarycarpentry.org/\nhttps://www.rstudio.com/\nhttps://github.com/\nhttps://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects\nhttps://hackmd.io/sfN_8XIlQxWQn2UFRZ0kXA?view\nhttps://carpentries.org/"

Salehi, Assistant Professor, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, CSU, Chico\nWhen: Friday, Oct 26, 2018; 4pm\nWhere: Holt Hall 170\nAbstract\nOvarian cancer ranks fifth as the cause of cancer death in women. Due to nonspecific associated symptoms as well as lack of efficacious screening techniques at the disposal of patients, the survival rate for ovarian cancer has not significantly improved over the last two decades. Therefore, ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate of all gynecologic cancers. As a result, there is an urgent need to improve the current diagnostic techniques to detect early malignancies in the ovary. Here, I will describe the development of a novel real-time co-registered photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAT/US) prototype imaging system along with machine learning techniques as a future screening modality for early-stage ovarian cancer detection and characterization. Further information on low-cost photoacoustic microscopy system with a novel laser scanner will be discussed.\nDental caries is a prominent health problem that affects more than 90 percent of all dentate adults and more than two-thirds of children in the United States. The conventional approach for diagnosing caries is clinical examination and supplemented by radiographs. However, studies based on the clinical and radiographic examination methods often show low sensitivity. To address this challenge, we have introduced a novel approach combining deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging modality for classification of human oral tissues to detect early dental caries. The proposed technique was validated on ex vivo OCT images of human oral tissues, which attested to effectiveness of the proposed method. The sensitivity and specificity of distinguishing between different oral tissues were found to be ~98% and 100%, respectively. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning algorithms with OCT images to perform the automated diagnosis of early dental caries."

This year we’re expanding this event, registration is open to ALL undergraduates in the North State! As of 2-17-19 we we already have 22 students (about 5 teams) already registered!\nMore students means more funding is needed to keep everyone fed, caffinated and to provide excellent prizes to the winners. Sponsorship opportunities are still available. Contact us for more information on how you can contribute.\nWhat is the ASA DataFest?\nASA DataFest is a data hackathon for undergraduate students, sponsored by the American Statistical Association and founded at UCLA, in 2011. A data analysis problem is presented in the form of a dataset and an associated challenge. Teams of students get a dataset on Friday afternoon and work on the problem until Sunday afternoon where they present their findings. After two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, and presentation design, each team is allowed a few minutes and no more than two slides to impress a panel of judges. Prizes are given for Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Use of External Data.\nUndergraduates from all majors are welcome. Some of the most diverse teams have been the most successful.\nA key feature of ASA DataFest is that it brings together the data science community. Undergraduate students do the work, but they are assisted by roving consultants who are graduate students, faculty, and industry professionals.\nLearn more about this national event at the event website: http://chicodatafest.netlify.com/"

Our goal is to index the levels of \\(f\\).\nsuppressMessages(library(dplyr))\ndf &lt;- tibble(f = sample(letters, 20, replace=TRUE))\nThe solution I came up with relies on sorting the data, so let’s do that first.\no &lt;- order(df$f)\ndf &lt;- df[o,,drop=FALSE]\ndf$nf &lt;- match(df$f, unique(df$f))\n\n# check\nhead(df)\n## # A tibble: 6 x 2\n##   f        nf\n##   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n## 1 a         1\n## 2 d         2\n## 3 g         3\n## 4 g         3\n## 5 g         3\n## 6 i         4\nSurely there’s other ways to do this; R probably has a function for it. But I don’t didn’t know which function. Moreover, this solution is general enough to be used within a broader grouping variable \\(g\\) and does not require any variable to be a factor.\nnumber_levels &lt;- function(x) {\n  x &lt;- sort(x)\n  match(x, unique(x))\n}\ndf$g &lt;- as.character(gl(4, 5, labels=sample(LETTERS, 4)))\n\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  group_by(g) %&gt;%\n  mutate(gf = number_levels(f))\nIt requires some extra work if you want the numbered levels to be increasing across the levels of some grouping variable \\(g\\), but we can manage with some help from a rarely used assignment operator.\nindex_grouped_levels &lt;- function() {\n  idx &lt;- 0\n  nl &lt;- function(x) {\n    levels &lt;- number_levels(x) + idx\n    idx &lt;&lt;- max(levels)\n    levels\n  }\n  nl\n}\n\nigrp_levels &lt;- index_grouped_levels()\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  arrange(g, f) %&gt;%\n  group_by(g) %&gt;%\n  mutate(ngf = igrp_levels(f))\n\nA Simpler Solution\nOn the Tuesday after DataFest, I show off my work to Dr. Donatello, and she looks at me like I’m crazy. She says, “What about \\(\\texttt{as.numeric(f)}\\) called on a factor?” I respond, “Ffa, sha, wha?” Then she shows me, and we worked out this gem.\ndf &lt;- tibble(f = sample(letters, 20, replace=TRUE))\ndf$g &lt;- as.character(gl(4, 5, labels=sample(LETTERS, 4)))\n\n# as.numeric() on a concatenated factor\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(g), f) %&gt;%\n  mutate(gf = paste0(g, f)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(mgf = as.numeric(as.factor(gf)))\n\n# my strategy\nigrp_levels &lt;- index_grouped_levels()\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  group_by(g) %&gt;%\n  mutate(ngf = igrp_levels(f))\n\nall(df$mgf == df$ngf)\n## [1] TRUE"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Lately, I, Edward, have been programming in Julia a lot. Two times in the last week, I’ve needed a function like R’s tapply(), but in Julia. With a little bit of searching around the interwebs, I hacked together a reasonable equivalent to R’s tapply() written in Julia. This blog post will explain the function tapply() and briefly introduce the two examples where I used tapply(). Last, I’ll provide my Julia code which replicates R’s tapply() function."

While working on a non-DSL version of Stan, I was attempting to take a derivative of something like a random effects linear model with respect to the random intercept. As it turns out, such a derivative needs the sum of the intercepts as grouped by their unique ID."

    "section": "tabulate values",
    "text": "tabulate values\nIn order to efficiently run a function like tapply(), I want a count of how many times each distinct value appears in a vector. R calls such a function table. Let’s first load up Julia and share with Julia some of the vectors we’ve been using in our examples.\nlibrary(JuliaCall)\njulia_assign(\"x\", x)\n\n## Julia version 1.5.0 at location C:\\Users\\rache\\AppData\\Roaming\\R\\data\\R\\JULIAC~1\\julia\\V15~1.0\\bin will be used.\n\n## Loading setup script for JuliaCall...\n\n## Finish loading setup script for JuliaCall.\n\njulia_assign(\"g\", g)\njulia_assign(\"y\", y)\njulia_assign(\"groups\", groups)\nI called my version of this function table in Julia, too. Here’s the source code, much of which I borrowed from the Julia package StatsBase.jl,\nfunction table(x::Vector)\n    d = Dict{eltype(x), Int}()\n    for v in x\n        idx = Base.ht_keyindex2!(d, v)\n        if idx &gt; 0\n            @inbounds d.vals[idx] += 1\n        else\n            @inbounds Base._setindex!(d, 1, v, -idx)\n        end\n    end\n    return d\nend\n\n## table (generic function with 1 method)\nSo now we can call our Julia function.\ntable(g)\n\n## Dict{String,Int64} with 5 entries:\n##   \"B\" =&gt; 2\n##   \"A\" =&gt; 2\n##   \"C\" =&gt; 3\n##   \"D\" =&gt; 1\n##   \"E\" =&gt; 2\nBecause Julia doesn’t inherently have a table type, I used a dictionary.\nNext, I wrote a function which I named group. This is equivalent to R’s split(). Since Julia already has a function named split, I chose a different name.\nfunction group(x::Vector, g::Vector)\n    gt = eltype(g)\n    gt &lt;: Number && gt != Int && (g = convert.(Int, g))\n    t = table(g)\n    d = Dict(k =&gt; Vector{eltype(x)}(undef, v) for (k, v) in t)\n    ug = collect(keys(t))\n    u = gt &lt;: Number ? ug : Dict(k =&gt; i for (i, k) in pairs(ug))\n    c = zeros(Int, length(d))\n    @inbounds for i in eachindex(g, x)\n        gi = g[i]\n        ui = u[gi]\n        c[ui] += 1\n        d[gi][c[ui]] = x[i]\n    end\n    return d\nend\n\n## group (generic function with 1 method)\nThe function group() groups the elements of x into groups based on the groups defined in g.\ngroup(x, g)\n\n## Dict{String,Array{Float64,1}} with 5 entries:\n##   \"B\" =&gt; [3.0, 4.0]\n##   \"A\" =&gt; [1.0, 2.0]\n##   \"C\" =&gt; [5.0, 6.0, 7.0]\n##   \"D\" =&gt; [8.0]\n##   \"E\" =&gt; [9.0, 10.0]\nLet’s compare this to what R’s function split() does. The order is not the same, so take a second to convince yourself the grouped elements of x appropriately match.\nsplit(x, g)\n\n## $A\n## [1] 1 2\n## \n## $B\n## [1] 3 4\n## \n## $C\n## [1] 5 6 7\n## \n## $D\n## [1] 8\n## \n## $E\n## [1]  9 10\nFinally, here is an equivalent to tapply(), which I named mapg() (think map groups). I also added an option to first sort the groups in g, just in case that proves helpful (which it did, in the details of the second example). Notice that I changed the order of the arguments to better match the order of the arguments to Julia’s function map(), namely the function to be applied to the groups comes first.\nfunction mapg(f, x, g; sortfirst = false)\n    v = collect(group(x, g))\n    z = sortfirst ? sort(v, by = x -&gt; first(x)) : v\n    return map(y -&gt; f(last(y)), z)\nend\n\n## mapg (generic function with 1 method)\nLet’s use mapg() to print out some integers in a “pretty” format.\nfunction f(x)\n  lx = length(x)\n  out = \"\"\n  if lx == 1\n    out *= \"$(x[1])\"\n  else\n    out *= lx == 2 ? \"$(x[1]), $(x[2])\" : \"$(x[1]) - $(x[end])\"\n  end\n  return out\nend\n\n## f (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\ns = mapg(f, y, groups, sortfirst = true)\n\n## 4-element Array{String,1}:\n##  \"1.0 - 3.0\"\n##  \"6.0, 7.0\"\n##  \"9.0 - 11.0\"\n##  \"13.0\"\n\njoin(s, \", \")\n\n## \"1.0 - 3.0, 6.0, 7.0, 9.0 - 11.0, 13.0\"\nIf you are following along, try calling mapg() without the sortfirst = true argument to better understand how sorting helps."

    "text": "On April 1-3rd, Chico State University hosted the ASA DataFest 2022. DataFest is an event hosted by the Chico State Data Initiative (DSI), organized by Doctor Robin Donatello. Students were presented with undisclosed data on Friday and then worked through the weekend to gain the best insights into the confidential, real-world data sets. After long nights and early mornings, teams presented their findings to the experienced panel of judges for a chance at prizes and certificates. The event is part of the university’s efforts to provide training, expand collaboration and encourage new research in the field of Data Science and Data Analytics.\nKick-off began at 5:30 p.m. on Friday, April 1st, when teams from both Sacramento State and Chico State arrived to unravel their first data sets. 29 students made up the six different teams, with majors from all across the board. This year we had representation from Engineering (6.8%), Statistics (17%), Mathematics (13.7%), Computer Science (51.7%), Natural Sciences (Biology) (3.4%), Social Sciences (3.4%) and Business Information Systems (3.4%). The contestants’ experience in programming varied greatly, with some who were very well-versed and others who were just beginners.\nBy Sunday, the teams began wrapping up their findings and preparing for presentations, which were limited to five minutes each. Our panel of judges included: Stewart He, Data Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab; Monica So, Assistant Professor at Chico State University; Kevin Buffardi, Faculty; and Christine Leistner, Faculty.\nEach team displayed great teamwork and demonstrated how working together can help you in the long run. With that said, the hardwork and dedication each team showed us reflected very heavily on this year’s winners. The winning teams of this year’s DataFest were:\n\nBest Analysis: K-Wildcat\nBest Discovery: K-Wildcat\nBest Visualization: Team Money\nJudge’s Choice: Lambda\n\nAcknowledgements\nIn addition to all the data exploration that took place throughout the weekend, we would like to give a special thank you to our sponsors: Chico State Data Science Initiative, American Statistical Association, ChicostArt, Center for Entrepreneurship at Chico State University, CSU Chico College of Business, Payless Building Supply, Math Club, and Stoble Coffee Roasters. Without the help of these amazing businesses and organizations, none of this would be possible.\nLastly, we would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge everyone who took the time to help build DataFest from the ground up. Support for the Data Science Initiative at Chico State by departments, organizations, and businesses like these are what make events for students possible.\nFollowing this year’s DataFest, the DSI is already looking to plan next year’s DataFest and looks forward to exposing more students to real world data issues. If you would like to be directly involved in next year’s festivities, please contact Robin Donatello at rdonatello@csuchico.edu."

    "text": "This is a quick-and-dirty introduction that will explain what SQL is, how it is used, and what some SQL queries look like in R using the dplyr package. SQL (sometimes pronounced “sequel”) stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language used to manipulate data in Relational Database Management Systems and it “is one of the most common languages for interacting with data” (source sqltutorial.org). SQL consists of three main languages under the same umbrella:\nThough SQL has a specific set of standards written by the American Standards Institute (ANSI), the user base constantly requires new features and capabilities. To accommodate this, there are a few different SQL “dialects” created by companies such as Oracle and Microsoft each with different syntaxes. In this tutorial, all SQL syntax used will be valid across all database systems.\nBefore going into SQL code, there are some important terms to know before creating a database. A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table whose value is unique for every record in the table. This can often be as simple as an integer ID or the combination of an ID and a date. A foreign key is a column in the table that refers to the primary key of another table. An example of this could be a situation where there is a table for purchases with a column for item number. The item number column is a foreign key that refers to the primary key item number of an items table with product information. For a more in-depth tutorial, I suggest reading through the Programiz tutorial."

    "text": "Building a database in SQL\nBuilding a database requires a schema. This shows the organization of the data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed. Below is an example of a simple relational database schema with seven tables: \n(image source)\nThe above schema is actually incomplete as only primary keys are identified (with an *) and we are left to assume that foreign keys have the same column name as the primary key it refers to. For example, job_id in the employees table is a foreign key for the job_id primary key in the jobs table. The “crows feet” notation connecting each table defines how many of each record there is for each relationship. They aren’t as important when using SQL, but they are necessary knowledge when one has to interact with a real database. I’ll explain the relationship between employees and jobs as an example. The connector on the jobs table signifies that every employee has one and only one job_id reference to a job in the jobs table. The connector on the employees table means every job_id may be associated with zero or more records (people) in the employees table."

    "section": "Data Definition Language",
    "text": "Data Definition Language\nIn the industry, these commands are often restricted to be used by only the Database Management group. This is so that no random person in the company can edit the database and potentially destroy sensitive information. To show examples of database creation using SQL, I will create the jobs table. The following code chunk contains comments with more details:\n-- The notation at the start of this line denotes a comment, everything after \"--\" will be ignored\n-- All SQL commands must end in a semicolon \";\"\n-- Most SQL command words are in all caps, but this can depend on the system\n-- First we have to create the database, this one will be called \"HR\"\nCREATE DATABASE HR;\n\n-- The CREATE TABLE command creates a table and takes the columns with data types as the argument\n-- The basic syntax looks like this:\nCREATE TABLE table_name (\n  column1 datatype,\n  column2 datatype,\n  ...\n);\n\n-- Here is the full code to create the jobs table:\nCREATE TABLE jobs (\n    job_id INT (11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    job_title VARCHAR (35) NOT NULL,\n    min_salary DECIMAL (8, 2) DEFAULT NULL,\n    max_salary DECIMAL (8, 2) DEFAULT NULL\n);\nIn the above code chunk, there were some new commands that may not look familiar. I’ll explain each column line-by-line.\n\nThe job_id column will be integer data. The number in parentheses tells the database the maximum number of digits that a job_id can have, in this case it is 11. The AUTO_INCREMENT command is an automatic function that runs whenever a new job is added to the table. Finally, PRIMARY KEY tells us this is the primary key.\nThe job_title column has a datatype called VARCHAR. This is a keyword meaning character data that is varying, essentially it is string data. The maximum length of a job_title is 35 characters, and the row cannot be empty. The NOT NULL command forces all records to have a job_title.\nThe last two columns, min_salary and max_salary, are very similar. They both have decimal data type, with 8 digits before the decimal and 2 digits after. Also, they both have DEFAULT NULL commands meaning that they are not required values when adding a new job. Adding a new job without specifying salaries will make those attributes empty.\n\nTo denote a foreign key, the structure looks like this:\nCREATE TABLE table_name (\n  column1 datatype,\n  column2 datatype,\n  ...\n  -- column3 is a primary key in another table\n  FOREIGN KEY (column2) REFERENCES another_table_name (column3)\n);\nAdditional commands are necessary to add to CREATE TABLE for when a table or record is deleted, but those are beyond the scope of this introduction. Other commands in the Data Definition language are shown below:\n-- See how these commands are not enclosed in parentheses?\n-- Little syntax differences like these can depend on the specific software being used\n-- However, all SQL commands end with a semicolon ;\n\nALTER TABLE table_name\nADD new_column datatype\nDROP old_column\nRENAME TO NEW_TABLE_NAME;\n\nDROP TABLE table_name;\n\n-- The ALTER TABLE command can also change column names and data definitions with RENAME and MODIFY"

In these examples, I did not include a primary key for employees so we can assume the first and last name together are the primary key.

However, there are other commands in the language such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. The basic format of a SQL query looks like this:\nSELECT select_list\nFROM table_name;\nUsing R, this command would look like:\nselect(data = table_name, column1, column2, ...)\nThe select list can be any number of comma-separated column names or an asterisk * to denote all columns in the table. When evaluating the SELECT statement, the database system evaluates the FROM clause first and then the SELECT clause. You can also do arithmetic in the SELECT clause, a couple of examples are below with their R translation and output:\nSELECT first_name, last_name, salary, salary * 1.25\nFROM employees;\nemployees %&gt;% select(first_name, last_name, salary) %&gt;%\n  mutate(raise = salary * 1.25)\n## # A tibble: 4 × 4\n##   first_name last_name salary  raise\n##   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 Curly      Morris    10000  12500 \n## 2 Larry      Cambridge 10000  12500 \n## 3 Moe        Wallace   12500  15625 \n## 4 Joe        Frasier   13333. 16667.\nSELECT AVG(salary), COUNT(DISTINCT(salary)), ROUND(salary, 0) -- round to 0 decimal places\nFROM employees;\nemployees %&gt;% transmute(avg_salary = mean(salary),\n          count_distinct = n_distinct(salary), trunc_salary = floor(salary))\n## # A tibble: 4 × 3\n##   avg_salary count_distinct trunc_salary\n##        &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1     11458.              3        10000\n## 2     11458.              3        10000\n## 3     11458.              3        12500\n## 4     11458.              3        13333\nSELECT MAX(salary), MIN(salary)\nFROM employees;\nemployees %&gt;% transmute(max_sal = max(salary), min_sal = min(salary))\n## # A tibble: 4 × 2\n##   max_sal min_sal\n##     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1  13333.   10000\n## 2  13333.   10000\n## 3  13333.   10000\n## 4  13333.   10000\nTo get data from other tables and join it to this one, we use a JOIN clause. Using INNER JOIN, we can select the rows that have a record in both tables. SQL also supports LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. The format looks like this:\nSELECT first_name, last_name, job_title\nFROM employees\nINNER JOIN jobs ON job_id = job_id;\n-- the name before the equals sign is the primary key in the employees table\nIn R, it might look like this:\nemployees %&gt;% select(first_name, last_name, job_id) %&gt;%\n  inner_join(jobs, by=c(\"job_id\"=\"job_id\"))\n## # A tibble: 4 × 4\n##   first_name last_name job_id job_title   \n##   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       \n## 1 Curly      Morris         1 Janitor     \n## 2 Larry      Cambridge      2 Maintenenace\n## 3 Moe        Wallace        3 Electrical  \n## 4 Joe        Frasier        4 Manager\nSQL queries can be powerful, and they can also get huge if you have to join multiple tables. This introduction does not go in depth, so to learn more you should do some research. If you know R, you will see some parallels between the dplyr package and SQL queries. In fact, R actually supports SQL to get data straight from central relational databases. In this introductory tutorial, databases were introduced, basic examples were given for each of the three SQL languages, and some queries were shown in the R programming language.\n\nJoseph Shifman is a Computer Science major with a minor in Math.

Here we will see what the relationship between temperature and depth shallower than 500 meters.\n\nLibraries\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n\nStep 1 - Import and Setup Dataset\nOur first step will be to import CalCOFI data and filter for our desired depth, done by the R code below.\n#Base Dataset\nCalCOFI &lt;- read.csv(\"CalCOFI.csv\")\n\n# Depth lower than 500 filtered out\nCalCOFI &lt;- CalCOFI %&gt;%\nfilter(Depthm &lt; 500)\n\n\nStep 2 - Initial Visualization\nBefore we begin modeling, we will want to see if linear modeling is applicable in this case. We can do this by some data visualization with a linear trend line, done by the R code below.\nCalCOFI %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(Depthm, T_degC)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)\n\nBased on the graph above, the fit can be roughly described as linear and makes linear regression applicable.\n\n\nStep 3 - Build and Fit Model\nNow we can Build and fit out model to our data, done by the R code below.\n# Build\nmodel &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"lm\")\n\n# Fit\nfit &lt;- model %&gt;%\n  fit(T_degC~Depthm, data = CalCOFI)\n\n\nStep 4 - Interpretation\nOur last step is to interpret the model we have fit. So to view our coefficients, see R code below.\ntidy(fit)\n## # A tibble: 2 × 5\n##   term        estimate std.error statistic p.value\n##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 (Intercept)  15.0    0.00415       3609.       0\n## 2 Depthm       -0.0239 0.0000225    -1065.       0\nFrom this we can see an association of depth to temperature of -0.0239. This means that on average, for every single meter increase of depth would result a decrease in temperature of 0.0239 Celsius."

    "text": "Fooling Facial Recognition Software Using Convoltional Generative Adversarial Networks\n\nBackground\nFacial Recognition software is becoming more and more prevalent in our daily lives from our phones to law enforcement. To help prevent the misuse of this kind of software we should further our understanding of these algorithms so they don’t remain as mysterious black boxes. This project’s goal was to test the accuracy of open-source pre-trained Facial Recognition models using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks or DCGANs. The DCGAN was used to generate images from random noise which would then be scored based on what confidence score it can elicit from pre-existing facial recognition models for a specific person’s Identity (such as The Rock). This project focuses on generating images that are identified as one of four recognized Identities by the recognition model. The generated test images that had a high confidence score of being a recognized image were subsequently looked at by humans to see if they looked like their classified identities. This will give us insight on how an end user can create fake generated images and still elicit high confidence scores from facial recognition software.\n\n\nExperiment Overview\n\n\nNoise:\n\nnormally distributed random numbers\n\n\n\nGenerator: Deep Convolutional Generator\nInput Layer:\n\n100 values Hidden Layers:\nFully Connected\nTransposed Convolution A.K.A Deconvolution\nActivation Function: LeakyReLU\n\nOutput Layer:\n\n224 x 224 pixels\nActivation Function: Sigmoid\n\n\n\nFacial Recognition Model\nVGGFace2 Models implemented in Keras\n\nInput preprocessing\nConvolutional Architectures\nResNet50 and SENet50\n\nOutput:\n\nConfidences on 8631 Identities\n\n\n\nTraining the Generator\nSetup in Jupyter using Python\n\nEach Generator focuses on 1 Identity\nBatch size of 5\nLoss based on how high a confidence the Recognition Model outputs\nLoss Calculated using Cross Entropy\nExponentially Decaying Learning Rate\n\n\n\nGPU:\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti with Max-Q Design\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nReal Face Controls\n\n\n\nGenerated Images\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results of this project show that it is possible to train a Generator for each Identity in the VGGFace2 and achieve a high confidence score. This method is still contingent on having access to the full model. This indicates that open source models such as these can be fooled by potentially malicious actors while other closed-source models may remain safe, but more research would be advised. Future research would best be targeted at replication using smaller generators, testing other learning rates and loss functions, testing this method for Facial Detectors since they are often paired with Facial Recognition, and using this method to improve model accuracy through training with generated false images."

The lab was named after late 19th and early 20th centuries prominent journalist, activist, and researcher Ida B. Wells. Click here for a brief biography of Ida B. Wells. The goal of the lab is to “rethink and retool data for justice”. The lab addresses a variety of issues from revealing companies engaged in immigrant surveillance to developing strategies to aid formerly incarcerated small business owners. Additionally, the lab has a variety of tech and social justice initiatives. The lab has lots of cool projects! The Barred Business Project provides business grants to support the work of formerly incarcerated Black, Transgender, Queer, Native, and Disabled business owners. In order to further enhance the mission to help these groups, the team leveraged data to tell stories by creating an interactive map. Here you can see the map. They also provide a list of resources for community engagement. One I found particularly interesting was the Equitable Internet Initiative. This initiative seeks to increase internet access in underserved Detroit neighborhoods. One of the reasons I found this initiative particularly interesting was the emphasis on community engagement. The majority of the workers come from the neighborhoods they work in. This is just one of the initiatives the lab is a part of."

The lab accentuates mapping due to the ease of understanding. There are likely surveillance technologies used in the community many are unaware of. To address this we could research the surveillance technologies used in our community. Then this information could be used to create a map for public use.

    "text": "Internships\nOur partnership with the Center for Healthy Communities’ Research & Evaluation team has been growing! Every semester we have placed 1-2 students from Statistics or other data related majors with them in paid internships, many of which have resulted in longer term paid positions. Some students even stayed on after graduation until finding a full time position or starting graduate school.\nOur partnership with Project DA-FANH allowed for the expansion of this internship to other organizations on campus including the Center for Regenerative Agriculture and Resilient Systems, Institutional Research and Strategic Analytics, and the Louis Stokes Alilance for Minority Participation. You can read about these partners on the project webpage.\nWith one more fall cohort of internships, this USDA grant funded project aiming to build pathway for students of color in the intersection of Data Science/Data Analytics within food, agriculture, natural resources and human sciences (FANH) careers. Carrying 3 units, this experience could count towards the DS Certificate, or perhaps your major while providing an authentic career experience using data to make decisions."

    "text": "What is the ASA DataFest?\nASA DataFest is a data hackathon for undergraduate students, sponsored by the American Statistical Association and founded at UCLA, in 2011. A data analysis problem is presented in the form of a dataset and an associated challenge. Teams of students get a dataset on Friday afternoon and work on the problem until Sunday afternoon where they present their findings. After two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, and presentation design, each team is allowed a few minutes and no more than two slides to impress a panel of judges. Prizes are given for Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Use of External Data.\nUndergraduates from all majors are welcome. Some of the most diverse teams have been the most successful.\nThis event is open to ALL undergraduates in the North State!\nLearn more about this national event at the event website: https://norcaldatafest.netlify.app/\n\nRegistration closes March 29th"

    "section": "",
    "text": "On April 1-3rd, Chico State University hosted the ASA DataFest 2022. DataFest is an event hosted by the Chico State Data Initiative (DSI), organized by Doctor Robin Donatello. Students were presented with undisclosed data on Friday and then worked through the weekend to gain the best insights into the confidential, real-world data sets. After long nights and early mornings, teams presented their findings to the experienced panel of judges for a chance at prizes and certificates. The event is part of the university’s efforts to provide training, expand collaboration and encourage new research in the field of Data Science and Data Analytics.\nKick-off began at 5:30 p.m. on Friday, April 1st, when teams from both Sacramento State and Chico State arrived to unravel their first data sets. 29 students made up the six different teams, with majors from all across the board. This year we had representation from Engineering (6.8%), Statistics (17%), Mathematics (13.7%), Computer Science (51.7%), Natural Sciences (Biology) (3.4%), Social Sciences (3.4%) and Business Information Systems (3.4%). The contestants’ experience in programming varied greatly, with some who were very well-versed and others who were just beginners.\nBy Sunday, the teams began wrapping up their findings and preparing for presentations, which were limited to five minutes each. Our panel of judges included: Stewart He, Data Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab; Monica So, Assistant Professor at Chico State University; Kevin Buffardi, Faculty; and Christine Leistner, Faculty.\nEach team displayed great teamwork and demonstrated how working together can help you in the long run. With that said, the hardwork and dedication each team showed us reflected very heavily on this year’s winners. The winning teams of this year’s DataFest were:\n\nBest Analysis: K-Wildcat\nBest Discovery: K-Wildcat\nBest Visualization: Team Money\nJudge’s Choice: Lambda\n\nAcknowledgements\nIn addition to all the data exploration that took place throughout the weekend, we would like to give a special thank you to our sponsors: Chico State Data Science Initiative, American Statistical Association, ChicostArt, Center for Entrepreneurship at Chico State University, CSU Chico College of Business, Payless Building Supply, Math Club, and Stoble Coffee Roasters. Without the help of these amazing businesses and organizations, none of this would be possible.\nLastly, we would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge everyone who took the time to help build DataFest from the ground up. Support for the Data Science Initiative at Chico State by departments, organizations, and businesses like these are what make events for students possible.\nFollowing this year’s DataFest, the DSI is already looking to plan next year’s DataFest and looks forward to exposing more students to real world data issues. If you would like to be directly involved in next year’s festivities, please contact Robin Donatello at rdonatello@csuchico.edu."
