This guide details the **minimum expectations for participation to maintain status as a Faculty Affiliate** of the Wildcat Data Hub (WDH/ "The Hub"), part of the Data Science Initiative (DSI) at California State University, Chico.

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## A Partnership Based on Performance
Your affiliation with the WDH is a renewable, **performance-based service partnership**, designed to recognize individuals who provide substantive and sustained contributions to advancing the WDH's research and services to our students, staff, fellow faculty, and community.
:::

# Wildcat Data Hub Mission and Services

The Wildcat Data Hub (WDH) at Chico State serves as a **consulting and support service** designed to support both campus and community researchers, including undergraduate and graduate students, staff, faculty, and community members.

## Goals and Role of The Hub

The WDH is dedicated to providing **high-quality support** for research projects while creating **paid, hands-on learning opportunities** for students, through a mix of pro-bono and fee-based services.

We fulfill this role by offering:

* Free drop-in consultation and coding support
* Short- and long-term project assistance provided by qualified students and experienced faculty on a fee-based system

## Core Services

The WDH offers comprehensive support across the research lifecycle, including:

* Support for programming languages (**R, Python, SQL**, and more)
* Data cleaning and transformation
* Data collection tools and techniques
* Data visualization and reports
* Reproducible research techniques
* Data analysis using statistical modeling and machine learning
* Developing measurable outcomes for research and grant proposals

# Minimum Service and Communication Requirements

Affiliation with the WDH is contingent upon **active contribution** toward the Hub's mission of supporting data-driven research and analysis across CSU Chico and our community.

## Mandatory Annual Engagement

::: {.callout-important}
## Annual Contribution Required
Affiliates must contribute to **at least one (1) WDH service activity or project per calendar year** to maintain their active status and qualify for renewal. Failure to meet this expectation may result in the non-renewal or removal of affiliate status at the end of the year.
:::

Examples of qualifying activities include:

* **Contributing to a WDH project:** Providing specialized data analysis, programming, or research support to an official WDH project.
* **Hosting weekly Community Coding hours:** Offering time for drop-in programming support to students, staff, and faculty through our Community Coding program. Note: This is an ongoing commitment; one session will not suffice.
* **Recruit a client to the Wildcat Data Hub:** Securing a client, whether at the university or in the community, for The Hub's business.
* **Grant Proposals:** Writing, applying to, and receiving grants for The Hub to use to provide funding to training, equipment, students, or affiliates.

## Communication Standards

When you become an affiliate, you may be sent projects for consideration based on your skillset and domain knowledge. While you are not required to accept and work on a project, the following is expected:

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
### Response Required Within 2 Business Days!
> **Acknowledgement of receipt and an initial assessment of the feasibility of the project and your availability to work on it is expected within two business days**.
:::

**Timely response is mandatory**, even if you ultimately decline the request, to ensure that incoming client requests are handled promptly. Chronic failure to meet this communication standard will constitute an inadequate contribution to service and may result in non-renewal of your affiliation.

# Policy and Affiliation Compliance

Faculty affiliates are subject to and must comply with all applicable university policies and procedures, especially those relating to research integrity, intellectual property, and data security.

## Mandatory Affiliation Disclosure

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
Affiliates must **proactively acknowledge the Wildcat Data Hub** in all professional output and communication when the work in question utilized WDH resources, services, or personnel.
:::

Affiliates are expected to list the WDH as one of their affiliations in:

* CVs
* Talks
* Papers
* Grant proposals

If scholarly work is conducted using the WDH (e.g., using WDH resources or staff time), the WDH must be listed as an **institutional affiliation**, and any WDH staff contributors must be listed on the resulting research or scholarly output.

## Authorship and Integrity Standards

Affiliates must adhere to institutional standards for **research integrity**.

* Authorship on publication resulting from WDH collaboration should be limited to only those individuals who have contributed in a meaningful and substantive way to its intellectual content.
* Passive affiliate status alone does not guarantee authorship on WDH-produced or -supported works.
