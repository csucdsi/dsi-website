## Seminar Overview

-   Are you looking for an internship?

Come join us to learn about the exciting summer internships our current Masters in Data Science and Analytics students participated in last summer. We will also be inviting our internship partners to come share about their opportunities as well.

## Schedule (in progress)

| Date | Speakers | Organization | Topic |

| 10/17 | Khushi Choudary and Jayana Sarma | [Western Weather](https://www.westernweathergroup.com/) | The internship focused on engineering the software platform for "Joules," a conversational Al assistant we co-developed. Our goal was to architect and build a production-ready, full-stack Al chatbot from the ground up. The primary deliverable was a high-performance application that successfully integrates advanced NLP models to make complex weather data accessible through simple, natural language. |
