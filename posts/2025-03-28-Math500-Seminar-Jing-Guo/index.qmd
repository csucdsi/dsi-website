### 🧠 Graph Learning from Smooth Signals and Regressors (GLReg)

How do we learn the underlying structure of a graph when signals are both smooth and influenced by covariates?

Join **Dr. Jing Guo** as she presents a novel graph learning framework that combines:
- **Smoothness of signals on nodes**
- **Linear regression using node-level predictors**

This model (GLReg) enables the **inference of graph topology** using real-world, noisy data and can be applied to domains like:
- 🌍 Geographical data  
- 🧬 Biomedical networks  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social networks

### 📊 What You'll Learn
- How to infer a **graph Laplacian** from both response and predictor signals
- The interaction between smooth signals and regressors
- Applications using both **simulated and real-world data**
