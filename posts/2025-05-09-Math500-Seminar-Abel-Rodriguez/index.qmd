## 🧠 Seminar Overview

While party affiliation often drives how elected representatives vote, it's not the **whole story**.  

In this seminar, **Dr. Abel Rodriguez** introduces a data-driven approach to uncovering **ideological preferences** using statistical models and **voting data**.

You’ll learn how social scientists and statisticians use tools like:
- **Latent Factor Models**
- **Item Response Theory (IRT)**
- Ideological scaling

to map out where legislators and judges fall on the political spectrum — including identifying *centrists*, *extremists*, and *outliers* across both parties.
