# Wildcat Data Hub

The Wildcat Data Hub (WDH) is a new consulting and support service at Chico State designed to support both campus and community researchers with all aspects of research relating to data. This includes undergraduate and graduate students, staff, faculty and our community members.

Through a mix of pro-bono and fee-based services, the WDH is dedicated to providing high-quality support for research projects while creating paid, hands-on learning opportunities for students.
