# Juan's 2024 DS Capstone

# The CFO Office Sign-in Dashboard App

This project is a web application developed using Shiny, an R package for building interactive web applications, enabling dynamic data presentation and user interaction.

My capstone project centered around streamlining common data analysis processes for Chico State's Student Services Center (SSC) [CalFresh](https://chicostatecalfresh.org/get-calfresh/) Outreach (CFO) office - a federally funded program (formerly known as food stamps) that helps students buy groceries. At Chico State, CalFresh Outreach assists students in checking eligibility, applying, and maintaining benefits.

## Goal

The CFO Office Sign-in Sheet recorded information about walk-in student visits to Chico State's Student Services Center (SSC) CalFresh Outreach (CFO) office.

The goal was to create a Dynamic Report using the Shiny app, data analyses, and final reports to keep track of visits to the office. These includes:

-   Daily visits
-   Weekly visits
-   Monthly visits
-   Visits by Term
-   Types of Assistance
-   Repeated Assistance
-   How they heard about CalFresh
